# 🎭 Who is Java34i?

Some people code to build apps.  
Some people code to build empires.  
I started coding because I was curious — now I can’t stop.

Hi, I’m a self-taught developer from 🇦🇹 Austria who loves turning ideas into digital things.  
Whether it’s a tiny game prototype, a Discord bot, or a sketchy website that somehow works — I’m here for the chaos and creativity.

## 🎮 Outside the Code

When I’m not staring at my screen trying to find that one missing semicolon, you’ll probably catch me:

- Button-mashing through boss fights 🎮  
- Sketching random characters ✏️  
- Falling down anime rabbit holes 📺  
- Overthinking life while listening to lo-fi 🎧

## 🔧 Current Toolbox

Things I tinker with:

- **Languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, (soon C#)
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Tools:** VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ, GitHub, CodePen

## 🌱 Learning Journey

Right now I’m focused on:

- Leveling up my object-oriented thinking with Java & C#
- Making smoother, more interactive frontends with JS
- Building side projects just for fun (and chaos)

## 🧪 Side Experiments

- Making weird stuff in p5.js  
- Practicing game dev ideas that never see the light of day  
- Redesigning things just because they "don’t feel right"

## 🧠 Fun Fact

I didn’t choose tech — tech chose me (probably during a late-night YouTube binge).
